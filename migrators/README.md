- [bunmigrator](migrators/bunmigrator/) for [uptrace/bun](https://github.com/uptrace/bun) (contributed by [@BrynBerkeley](https://github.com/BrynBerkeley))

If you're writing your own `Migrator`, I recommend you use the existing ones
as examples. Most migrators need to do some kind of file/directory hashing in
order to implement `Hash()` &mdash; you may want to use [the helpers in the
`common` subpackage](./common).
